{"title": "cinnamon", "text": "Cinnamon is a spice obtained from the inner bark of several tree species from the genus Cinnamomum. Cinnamon is used mainly as an aromatic condiment and flavouring additive in a wide variety of cuisines, sweet and savoury dishes, breakfast cereals, snack foods, teas, and traditional foods. The aroma and flavour of cinnamon derive from its essential oil and principal component, cinnamaldehyde, as well as numerous other constituents including eugenol.\n\nCinnamon is the name for several species of trees and the commercial spice products that some of them produce. All are members of the genus Cinnamomum in the family Lauraceae. Only a few Cinnamomum species are grown commercially for spice. Cinnamomum verum is sometimes considered to be \"true cinnamon\", but most cinnamon in international commerce is derived from the related species Cinnamomum cassia, also referred to as \"cassia\". In 2018, Indonesia and China produced 70% of the world's supply of cinnamon, Indonesia producing nearly 40% and China 30%.", "url_1": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Cinnamomum_Verum_vs_Cinnamomum_Burmannii.jpg", "url_2": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/CINNAMON_BUDS.jpg", "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cinnamon"}
