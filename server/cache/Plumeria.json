{"title": "Plumeria", "text": "Plumeria (), known as frangipani, is a genus of flowering plants in the subfamily Rauvolfioideae, of the family Apocynaceae. Most species are deciduous shrubs or small trees. The species variously are endemic to Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean, and as far south as Brazil and north as Florida (United States), but are sometimes grown as cosmopolitan ornamentals in warm regions. Common names for plants in the genus vary widely according to region, variety, and whim, but frangipani or variations on that theme are the most common. Plumeria is also used as a common name, especially in horticultural circles.", "url_1": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Chempakam.jpg", "url_2": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Bunga_kemboja_%28Plumeria%29_merah.JPG", "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumeria"}
