  "text": "Colocasia esculenta is a tropical plant grown primarily for its edible corms, a root vegetable most commonly known as taro (), among many other names (see \u00a7 Names and etymology below). It is the most widely cultivated species of several plants in the family Araceae that are used as vegetables for their corms, leaves, and petioles. Taro corms are a food staple in African, Oceanic, and South Asian cultures (similar to yams), and taro is believed to have been one of the earliest cultivated plants.",
